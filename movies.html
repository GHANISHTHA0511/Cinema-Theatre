                <h2>Piku</h2>
                <p>Piku is the kind of girl who doesn't shy away from responsibilities. The film takes audiences through the ups and downs and everyday problems she faces with her father.

                    Baba - Bhaskhor Banerjee (Amitabh Bachchan) is Piku's father. He is retired and spends most of his time obsessing about age-related issues.
                    
                    He is stubborn, dramatic and comes with his own set of problems... he has very specific, but unconventional, likes and dislikes and fixed ideologies. He is not a man who enjoys socialising. Baba is not the hero here, but the film takes a look into his household.</p>
